Set a group of HB-Rooms as a single 'Dwelling'. This is required in order to properly calculate
the Phius occupancy, lighting, and electrical equipment usage. 
-
If you are creating a single-family home, simply input all of your rooms
to this component. If you are creating a multi-unit (apartment) building, split up your rooms onto separate 
branches as appropriate. All of the Rooms on a single Branch will be set to the same 'dwelling'.
