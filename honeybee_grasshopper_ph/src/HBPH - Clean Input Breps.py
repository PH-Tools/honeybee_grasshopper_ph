"""
This component will try and clean up the input Brep solids. In particular, if any 
of the Breps have surfaces with a U or V count > 2, it will convert them into regular
flat trimmed surfaces. This is helpful if you are having trouble with Honeybee adding 
extra points or if you are getting errors about Edges being too small.
