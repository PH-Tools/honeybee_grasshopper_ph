"""
Sort a set of Geometry by that geometry's Z-Height. A new output branch will
be created for each set of geometry objects at that level. Use the '_tolernce' input 
to adjust if the groupings are not correct at first. This is useful if you are drawing
the floor plates for a multi-story building and want to organize them by level or
similar operations.
