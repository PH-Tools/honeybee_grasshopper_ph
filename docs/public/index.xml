      <description>Honeybee-PH and the Grasshopper toolkit are free and open-source. Feel free download and give it a try.
Requirements In order to successfully install Honeybee-PH, please make sure that your system already has all of the required software installed and working:
Rhino-3D v7+ Ladybug-Tools v1.5+ WUFI-Passive (If you want to open your files in WUFI-Passive) PHPP v9+ (If you want to open your files in PHPP) Windows OS. ðŸ˜§ While almost all the Rhino/Grasshopper tools work fine on MacOS, we are still having trouble getting Rhino to talk to Microsoft Excel on MacOS.</description>

      <description>Quick Start This guide will help you get up and running quickly with the Honeybee-PH toolkit for Rhino / Grasshopper. The Honeybee-PH toolkit is designed to allow users to add Passive House style data to their Honeybee models, and then export those models out to the Passive House modeling platforms WUFI-Passive and PHPP.
The simplest usage of the Honeybee-PH toolkit is demonstrated below. For detailed tutorials on full Passive House modeling and the use of all the new Honeybee-PH tools, check out Learn More.</description>

      <description>PH-Tools? PH-Tools is the umbrella project encompassing all of the various software tools we&amp;rsquo;ve been building to make Passive House energy modeling faster, easier and more fun. In the past we&amp;rsquo;ve made plugins for DesignPH, and standalone tools like IDF2PH and LBT2PH. The Honeybee-PH plugin is the new &amp;lsquo;official&amp;rsquo; plugin for Honeybee, written from the ground up to work seamlessly with Ladybug-Tools and Honeybee using their plugin-architecture. If you have questions on Honeybee-PH, or any of the other PH-Tools, check out the links and references below.</description>
