      <description>PH-Tools? PH-Tools is the umbrella project encompassing all of the various software tools we&amp;rsquo;ve been building to make Passive House energy modeling faster, easier and more fun. In the past we&amp;rsquo;ve made plugins for DesignPH, and standalone tools like LBT2PH. The Honeybee-PH plugin is our newest plugin, written for Honeybee from the ground up to work seamlessly with Ladybug-Tools using their plugin-architecture. If you have questions on Honeybee-PH, or any of the other PH-Tools, check out the links and references below.</description>
