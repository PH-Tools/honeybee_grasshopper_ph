Check out the first Honeybee-PH -> WUFI-Passive video tutorial series here: [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi6KNBJLE8H9i0O_Y7NYoZuu4ZYOEd0RE)

In this series, we'll take a simple single-family home building from blank Rhino scene to complete WUFI-Passive model. We will cover geometry, mechanical systems and more - all with a focus on how to use Honeybee-PH and the core workflows to make small project modeling simple and easy.
